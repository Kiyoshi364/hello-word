Sayin' HELLO to the World

I'm a low-level enthusiast programmer. (Have I got the order right?)
I kinda like everything related to language and how-things-work stuff.

I'm going to store my projects for inspiration for others programmers.
I just wish that when copying my code give me a reference.

And I hope that a write more there... :)
