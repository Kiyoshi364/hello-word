Sayin' HELLO to the World

I'm a low-level enthusiast programmer. (Have I got the order right?)
I kinda like everything related to language and how-things-work stuff.

I'm going to store my projects for inspiration for others programmers
inside this GitHub account.

Feel free to take a look, I just ask that when copying my
code, give me a reference.

By the way, if you wanna talk to me, currently I'm able to speak
Portuguese, English, (a bit of) Japanese and I also can understand
Spanish.

And I hope that a write more there... :)
