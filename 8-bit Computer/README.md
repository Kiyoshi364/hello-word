This is a software emulated 8-bit computer.

I tried to use the least amount of aritmetic operations
as possible (increment and decrement are used).

The code is made using static variables and function calls
to emulate "private" registers.

ToDo:
	- Machine code to micro instructions "circuit"
	- Assembly to Machine code converter
